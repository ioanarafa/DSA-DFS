Year I, semester II: Data structures and algorithms

course eleven: Depth First Traversal 

Definition: Depth First Traversal (or DFS) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited twice). To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array. A graph can have more than one DFS traversal.
Operations:
 1) DFS algorithm
